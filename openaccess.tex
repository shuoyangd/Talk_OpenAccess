    I'm a statistician. My research focuses on genetics, and

    So in commenting on open access, I'm focusing on scientific
    publications, and perhaps more narrowly, on the biological

  I could get the article through the UW Libraries web site, but it's

\note{I went back to some of my early papers, and found these

  \$18 for a 2-page paper?

  I understand that the publishing industry has a long history of
  screwy pricing, but you'd have to be either \textbf{desperate} or
  \textbf{stupid} to pay this.

  And for that 1999 Genetic Epidemiology article, published by Wiley,
  you have to register in order to find out that it's \$35 for just 24
  hours of access.

  PubMed Central is only for federally-funded research, has a one year
  embargo, and (as here) might not include the published version of the
  paper.

  PubMed Central is a good thing, but one generally can't wait a year,
  it's unfortunate that the published versions aren't always included,
  and from an author's point of view it can be a real hassle.

Most of the costs behind a research paper are paid by grants or
institutional funds. For most journals, peer review and editorial
oversight are unpaid.

There are real costs associated with journals, but in the end they are
all paid from the same sources (grants and institutional funds).

Do we really want to give away the product of our research and then
buy it back repeatedly, at great profit to the publishers?

And shouldn't the literature be available generally and not just to
those with access to well-funded research libraries?

\note{The Open Access discussion often gets tied up with discussion
  about peer review, predatory publishing, and journal impact
  factors.

  But to me, it is a completely separate issue, whether we want
  stringent peer review before publication or instead leave the
  evaluation entirely to post-publication review.

  On the other hand, the current culture is to evaluate researchers
  based on the perceived quality of the journals in which they've
  published. This makes it difficult to change to open access.

  If everyone's still going to send their best work to Science,
  Nature, \& Cell, then that work will continue to be locked up behind
  pay walls.

\note{The usual way in which publishing costs are paid are through a
  combination of subscriptions (both institutional and individual) and
  direct charges to the author.

  In the new open access model, the page charges are increased in
  order to eliminate the subscription fees. One might have a fee for
  all submitted manuscripts and not just those accepted for
  publication.

  I've not seen much discussion of other alternatives, but I would
  prefer to see endowments established, particularly for
  society journals.  Alternatively, journals might be
  funded directly through grants.

\note{The page charges, and the continued reliance on impact factors,
  lead to difficult choices, particularly for young investigators.

  Should I pay for open access, or should I let the subscribers pay
  and use the savings to do more experiments?

  Should I support open access journals, or should I continue to
  go after Science, Nature, \& Cell?

  The best scientists may confidently maintain their pure publication
  record.

  But more mediocre scientists, who may be just scraping by,
  probably don't feel they have that luxury.  A Nature paper can
  ``make you.''

\note{We need to send our best work to open access journals.

We need to find ways to support our junior colleagues, so that they
may do so as well.

We need to evaluate people based on their work and not by the name of
the journal in which it appeared. We all may say, ``Science and
Nature are often crap and there are lots of fantastic papers that
appear elsewhere.'' But somehow when we see Nature or Cell on
someone's CV, we still have an immediate, positive reaction.

I would like to see endowed journals, open forever.

The quickest way to free the product of federally funded research
would be to reform copyright law. If the product of our research were
forced open by law, the publishing industry would figure out how to
pay for it in short order.

But given the state of politics in the US, I'm not too optimistic
about that.
